    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>My go-to soft and gooey chocolate chip cookie recipe. Need I say more?</h4>
    <h2>Servings</h2>
    <h4>12, 2-3 Inch Cookies</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar (50g)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar, packed (150g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (150g)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>4 ounces milk or semi sweet chocolate chunks</li>
        <li>4 ounces dark chocolate chunks (or your preference)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F (180C)</li>
        <li>
            <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, salt and butter until a paste is formed with no lumps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to over-mix. <br>This will cause the gluten in the four to toughen which will result in cakier cookies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, <br>chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will become.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, <br>leaving at least 4 inches of space between cookies and 2 inches from the edges of the pan so that they will spread evenly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until edges have started to barely brown.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cool completely and enjoy!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
